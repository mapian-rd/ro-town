# Ro Town

This project was originally designed for RO (Ragnarok Online) damage calculations, and its purpose remains the same.

## Feature

It's still a work in progress, but I hope to include all the following functions:
1. Equipment crafting and storage
2. Status summary
3. DPS  calculator
4. Custom crafting
5. Import / Export data
6. Attractive summary

### P.S.

This project is based on Thailand's ROGGT version. Therefore, some aspects, such as aspd, may be different.
